# Fake News Detector

This project is a **Fake News Detection System** built using **Python** and **Machine Learning**. It predicts whether a given news article is real or fake based on its content. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled news articles, and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to make predictions.

## Features:

- **News Input**: The system takes a news article as input from the user.
- **Prediction**: The system predicts whether the news article is **real** or **fake**.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model is displayed to show how well it performs on the test data.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for building the system.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for building the machine learning model.
- **nltk**: Used for natural language processing and text analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression and Count Vectorizer for feature extraction.
